            Mentorship engagements provide an opportunity to give and receive feedback on a specific growth area. Any skill or area of professional development can be the focus of a mentorship engagement. As a mentee, you'll work on a focused skill over a set period of time with a mentor as your coach.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4" style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>
                Through mentorship, you will target a specific skill or growth area to work on. Mentorship empowers you to manage your own growth, and is meant to be customized and tailored to your unique personal ambitions and career objectives. Outcomes are initiated and owned by you, the mentee, to give you more control over your personal development.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4" style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>
                If you are a solo designer on a project, you will have the extra guidance of someone who can provide feedback on your work and skills you might not get otherwise. You'll be able to collect feedback on a skill you're working on that can help during mid and end of year reviews to show growth and improvement.

                      You may have identified your own growth area, and will want to ask your manager to help you find a mentor. Your manager may also identify a potential area for growth and ask if you'd be interested in having a mentor help you.
