                Conduct the user testing play to get specific feedback on your designs or experience from your target audience. There are many types of user testing that can be run to receive various levels of feedback. Depending on your testing goals and stage of the project, user testing can be run against individual screens, interactive prototypes, up to a fully developed experience.

                When redesigning an experience, run user testing of the existing product at the beginning of the project. This testing can be valuable when you are auditing a current experience and want to determine what is working well versus what needs to change.

                Run user testing during feature sprints of a design-only or design and development project. With feature sprint user testing, you can get quick feedback on acceptance and usability of designs and flows, allowing for verification and iteration before moving those designs into development. User testing can also help if there are two directions you are deciding between and can provide validation on decisions to the client.
