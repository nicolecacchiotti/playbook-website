              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The design direction workshop is conducted in order to create a cohesive vision between the WillowTree design team and client stakeholders. Visual language is incredibly subjective, and this workshop aims to remove subjectivity by aligning on target visuals and establishing a shared expressive visual language with stakeholders.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                This can be done with clients who have both existing and non-existing brands.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                When the client either has limited brand assets or no existing definitive design direction, system, or constraints.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Early in the discovery phase, when there's generally a higher level of ambiguity across the project disciplines. It can be helpful to have some definition around product goals in advance, but it isn't necessary.

                When the existing design or brand artifacts do not provide enough clarity into how design can best approach this product.

                A key component of the workshop is getting the stakeholders to react to a large sampling of images. Their reactions will help contextualize and build the vocabulary of the design direction. Ideally, 80-100 images of varying subject matter, visual styles, design specific elements (user mockups, abstract imagery, and photography allows for a more textured discussion from which we can begin to draw out ideas. If the workshop is to be done IRL, ensure there is prep time allotted for printing, cutting and arranging the photos in the physical space.
