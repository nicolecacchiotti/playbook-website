              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                When redesigning an experience, evaluate the usability of the existing product at the beginning of the project (i.e., baseline). This testing can be valuable when you are auditing a current experience and want to determine what is working well versus what needs to change. This will also providence evidence for the value of your changes when compared to usability of the redesigned experience.

                Run concept testing during the creative concept phase of a project or during a strategy project. This type of testing can provide feedback on a direction you want to take an experience, before getting too far down any one path. Users typically respond to multiple design concepts at a lower fidelity, as opposed to high fidelity screens or prototypes.

                Run usability testing during feature sprints of a design-only or design and development project. With feature sprint usability testing, you can get quick feedback on usability of designs and flows, allowing for verification and iteration before moving those designs into development. Usability testing includes evaluation of users' success, efficiency, and satisfaction completing a task. Usability testing can also help if there are two directions you are deciding between and can provide validation on decisions to the client.

                Doing a usability test of the full feature set of a product can help determine pain points and areas of confusion before a product launches. This information can inform a final round of tweaks to optimize the user experience or set up for a round of fast follows.

Moderated testing is best for projects in the early development stages, with specific audiences and lower fidelity designs. Always record moderated testing if possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Unmoderated:</strong> Unmoderated testing is best for validating concepts and testing quickly with a diverse group of contributors. Unmoderated testing is best for when you have very specific questions you want answered about a higher fidelity design or prototype.

                <li><strong>Comparison / preference tests:</strong> Run an comparison test if you are deciding between multiple versions of an experience. User groups are shown different versions of a particular experience to see which performs better. Try to avoid simply asking which design users prefer. Instead, ask which design users prefer for a specific purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Prototype / navigation tests:</strong> Use this test to evaluate the extent to which users can complete key tasks effectively, efficiently, and with satisfaction. You need to include follow-up rating scales (e.g., On a scale of 1-5, how difficulty (1) or easy (5) was it to complete the task?) or open-ended questions.</li>
                <li><strong>First click tests:</strong> Run this test to identify what users would interact with first on the screen given a specific prompt.</li>
                <li><strong>5-second tests:</strong> Run this qualitative test to gauge users first impressions of a screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Card sort / tree tests:</strong> Use these tests when you are designing or evaluating the information architecture of an experience. Card sort tests ask users to sort menu items themselves, while tree tests ask users to navigate to specific menu items in a set IA.</li>
                <li><strong>Smoke tests:</strong> Run if you need to test whether or not your target users will actually care about what you're creating for them.</li>
