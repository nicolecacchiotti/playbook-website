              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed italic">
                Using ChatGPT effectively involves clear, specific, and context-rich prompting. Here's a how-to guide:
              </p>

              <div className="mb-6">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Be clear and specific:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  The more specific your question, the better the AI can generate a relevant response. Instead of asking "What is the weather?" specify the location and time, like "What is the weather in New York City right now?"
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="mb-6">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Provide context:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  If you're asking a follow-up question or your question relies on prior information, include that context within the prompt. For example, instead of asking "Who won it?" you might ask "Who won the 2022 World Series?"
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="mb-6">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Specify the format if needed:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  If you require a response in a particular format, mention this in your question. For example, if you're asking for a summary of a topic, you can specify "Can you give me a bullet-point summary of the main causes of World War I?"
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="mb-6">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Directly instruct the model:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  If you want the model to think step by step or debate pros and cons before settling on an answer, you can instruct it to do so. For example: "Can you list the pros and cons of solar energy, then provide your best recommendation?"
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="mb-6">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Iterate and refine:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  If the initial response isn't satisfactory, you can ask the question differently, provide more context, or specify the format you need. Remember, the model doesn't remember past requests, so each question should contain all the necessary context.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="mb-8">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Use system prompts for more control:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Advanced users can make use of system-level instructions to control the model's behavior. For example, you can tell the model to "Speak like Shakespeare" or "Explain it as if I were a five-year-old."
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 text-gray-800">2. Join the Conversation</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                When interacting with ChatGPT, it's important to know that the model doesn't have a memory of previous interactions. It doesn't know who you are or what you've asked before. <strong>However, within a single session or conversation, it can refer to previous exchanges.</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Here are some tips for building upon previous interactions within a single conversation:
              </p>

              <div className="mb-6">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Maintain context within the session:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Since ChatGPT doesn't remember previous sessions, if you want to refer to something discussed earlier, include it within the current session. For example, if discussing a book in one prompt and asking about the author in the next, include the name of the book or the author to maintain context.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="mb-6">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Specify connections to previous responses:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  If you want to ask about or discuss something mentioned in a prior response in the current session, directly mention the relevant parts of that response in your new prompt.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="mb-6">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Sequentially build the conversation:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  In a multi-turn conversation, remember that ChatGPT processes all the preceding messages each time it generates a response. So, you can ask follow-up questions or explore different facets of a topic sequentially.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="mb-6">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Use clear referents:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  When referring back to something mentioned earlier, be as explicit as possible. Instead of saying "it," use the name or a clear description of what you're referring to.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="mb-8">
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Rephrase or repeat for clarity:</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  If the AI seems to have lost the thread of the conversation, rephrase your question or reintroduce the context to bring it back on track.
                </p>

                    Give the model a clear understanding of what you're asking. If you want a detailed response, ask for it explicitly. For example, "Describe in detail a user interface for a mobile app that helps users track their daily water intake."

                    Instead of asking everything in one go, break your query into stages. For example, first ask for a general concept, then ask for refinements or more detail based on the AI's responses.

                    If you're using the OpenAI API, you can adjust parameters like "temperature" and "max tokens." Higher temperature values (closer to 1) make the output more random, while lower values make it more focused and deterministic. Max tokens can be used to limit the length of the output.

                  body="Don't be tempted to take ChatGPT's output as the final solution. It's essential to remember that while ChatGPT can generate creative and diverse ideas, it doesn't have true understanding or creativity. Its outputs are based on patterns in the data it was trained on, and it doesn't have the ability to understand user needs, project goals, or design principles as a human designer does. Designers should use the model as a tool for ideation and exploration, rather than a source of definitive answers."

                  header="LACK OF CONTEXT"
                  body="ChatGPT doesn't have the ability to understand context in the way humans do. It doesn't remember past interactions, it doesn't know anything about the specific user or project unless it's included in the conversation, and it can sometimes generate responses that are plausible-sounding but incorrect or irrelevant. It's crucial to provide clear, specific, and context-rich prompts, and to critically evaluate the responses."

                  body="While ChatGPT can generate code-like text and work with data formats like JSON or HTML, its proficiency varies and it should not be relied on for precise, production-level code generation. The generated code or technical outputs need to be reviewed, refined, and tested by human coders."
