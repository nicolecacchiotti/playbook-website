                Sharing the journey of what we've accomplished and learned throughout a project helps strengthen our final recommendations by giving the audience context and evidence for why we've landed where we've landed.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                To save time from having to track down files and information at the end of the project, have a central location to store deliverables, insights, etc. along the way. Effective solutions are a team Google Drive or even a presentation deck where the team can drop content that can eventually be turned into slides.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                The format of an outbrief is typically a presentation deck. The DRIs should carve out time as far in advance of the outbrief as possible to put together a draft of the narrative around the project and start figuring out ways to showcase the project activities and learnings. This will help the team understand the scope of outbrief-specific tasks in addition to wrapping up the project itself.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                While an outbrief can be a time to pull out some stops and bring a wow factor in certain ways, it isn't the time for big reveals of information or recommendations. The final output shouldn't be a surprise to our key stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                The work should be approached collaboratively and iteratively along the way with the client to ensure there's alignment and satisfaction with the final results. The outbrief should be a recap of the journey our collective team has been on together through the engagement and a summary of solutions aligned upon prior to the outbrief.
              </p>
              
              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">4. Plan to practice and dry run the outbrief presentation</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Outbriefs usually consist of handoffs between teammates speaking to the work, may contain various media elements such as videos or slide transitions, and other logistics â€” not to mention they are a high stakes moment in a project. To ensure things go smoothly, plan to practice at least one run-through of the outbrief as a team.

                Show appreciation for the opportunity to have done the work. Even if questions and discussion were welcome throughout the outbrief, folks may have a few final things to share after the work has been shared in totality.
