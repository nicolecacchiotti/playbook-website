              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                In order to create user-centered digital experiences, it is important to identify early the user needs those experiences are expected to meet. A User Needs and Assumptions workshop allows you to surface, evaluate, and prioritize those needs to ensure you are designing to solve real problems for users. This workshop includes:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 ml-4">
                <li>Identifying key user needs your product or service should address</li>
                <li>Understand the clients' perspective and current understanding on their users and target audience priorities</li>
                <li>Identifying open questions and uncertainty related to "who" users are and their needs</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">At the beginning of a project</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Running this play early ensures that you're designing for the right set of user needs and have time to answer open questions about users.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">When the team and/or client are making assumptions about users' needs or relying on "guesses"</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                You might encounter disagreements about what user needs you're prioritizing and designing for. Running this play will allow you to facilitate an informed conversation between stakeholders and gain alignment with the client on the priority of user needs.
              </p>

                Running this play will help you get an idea of who your target audience is and a hypothesized set of user needs and attributes to explore with users.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                To prepare for the workshop, you will first need to create an initial target audience that you will use as a jumping off point during the session with your client stakeholders. It could be as simple as general users (e.g., dog owners for an app about pets). It could be more specific to a business goal (lapsed users, engaged users, new segment to target), or it could be based on existing segments from the client.
